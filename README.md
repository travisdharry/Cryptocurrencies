# Cryptocurrencies
Unsupervised Machine Learning project for University of Texas Data Analysis &amp; Visualization Program

## Overview
We analyzed a cryptocurrency dataset in order to determine which cryptocurrencies may be most useful to trade. We cleaned and scaled the data, then used the PCA method to trim the number of factors down to three. We then applied the K-means method to cluster the data and visualized this using HVPlot. This classified the cryptocurrencies into several different groups, which will make it possible to group them into portfolios for trading.
